# BuoyStats

A selection of MetOcean's lighthouses and buoys are equipped with meteorological and oceanographic sensors and transmit their data to Irish Lights HQ.
This data is then is published to their Twitter feeds after some formatting.

Unfortunately, MetOcean does not provide any nice charts or APIs to visualize the Twitter feeds.

This website parses data from a couple of those feeds and shows nicely-formatted graphs for each buoy.
